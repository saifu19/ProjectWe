        <p>
            Most people believe that learning happens exclusively in the brain. We disagree. In reality, learning involves the ability to take new actions, and that incorporates our whole selves - our intellect, our emotions, and our bodies.

        <p class="mb-0">
            Learning new skills requires repetition and patience, as it requires us to take new actions consistently to undo the old and embrace the new.
